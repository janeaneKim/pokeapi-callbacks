# pokeapi-callbacks

Created to practice callbacks for JS Callbacks Assignment for TTS. The code uses .then statements to attach callbacks to fetch 
information from the PokeAPI.

Basic functionality:

The search bar takes any whole number between 1 to 500 and displays the corresponding pokemon and sprite. 
Any values exceeding this range will return an error message.
